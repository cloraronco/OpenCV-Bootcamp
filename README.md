## About OpenCV-bootcamp
This free bootcamp is available on https://opencv.org/.  
To obtain a certificate, you must complete the quiz for each chapter.  
It is not possible to retake a quiz.  

## Introduction
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.  
It provides a comprehensive set of tools and functions for tasks such as image and video analysis, object detection, face recognition, feature extraction, and more.  
OpenCV is widely used in various applications, including robotics, computer vision research, and computer vision-based software development.  
It is available under the open-source BSD license, making it accessible to a wide range of developers and researchers.

## 00_display_image
This notebook will help you take your first steps in learning Image Processing and Computer Vision using OpenCV.  
You will learn some important lessons using some simple examples.  
In this notebook, you will learn the following:

* Reading an image
* Check image attributes like datatype and shape
* Matrix representation of an image in Numpy
* Color Images and splitting/merging image channels
* Displaying images using matplotlib
* Saving images
