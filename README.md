# OpenCV-Bootcamp
  
A training to get started with OpenCV 
  
## About OpenCV-bootcamp
This free bootcamp is available on https://opencv.org/.  
To obtain a certificate, I must complete the quiz for each chapter.  
It is not possible to retake a quiz.  

## Introduction
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.  
It provides a comprehensive set of tools and functions for tasks such as image and video analysis, object detection, face recognition, feature extraction, and more.  
OpenCV is widely used in various applications, including robotics, computer vision research, and computer vision-based software development.  
It is available under the open-source BSD license, making it accessible to a wide range of developers and researchers.  


### Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cloraronco/OpenCV-Bootcamp  
```
Each chapter contains one or more files, organized by concepts.  
Happy exploring!

## Display image
This course helped me take my first steps in learning Image Processing and Computer Vision using OpenCV.  
I learned some important lessons using some simple examples.  
In this notebook, I learned the following:  
  
* Reading an image
* Check image attributes like datatype and shape
* Matrix representation of an image in Numpy
* Color Images and splitting/merging image channels
* Displaying images using matplotlib
* Saving images

## Basic_image manipulations
In this course I covered how to perform image transformations including:  
  
* Accessing and manipulating images pixels  
* Image resizing  
* Cropping  
* Flipping

***
## Image annotation
In this notebook, I covered how to annotate images using OpenCV.  
I learned how to peform the following annotations to images.  
  
* Draw lines  
* Draw circles  
* Draw rectangles  
* Add text
  
These are useful when you want to annotate your results for presentations or show a demo of your application.  
Annotations can also be useful during development and debugging.

***
## Image enhancement
Image Processing techniques take advantage of mathematical operations to achieve different results.  
Most often we arrive at an enhanced version of the image using some basic operations.  
We will take a look at some of the fundamental operations often used in computer vision pipelines.  \
In this course, I covered:  
  
* Arithmetic Operations like addition, multiplication  
* Thresholding & Masking  
* Bitwise Operations like OR, AND, XOR

## Accessing the camera
In this short course, I learned how to access to the camera.
